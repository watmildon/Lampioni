# Lampioni

A map of street lights in Italy, created to support the [February 2026 monthly mapping project](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/progetto-del-mese-febbraio-2026-lampioni/141180) by the Italian OpenStreetMap community. Every street lamp you add to OpenStreetMap appears on this map. The more we map, the brighter Italy gets.
